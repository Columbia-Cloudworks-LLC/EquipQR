   - âœ… `getPrimaryEquipment()` - Get primary equipment
   - âœ… `addEquipmentToWorkOrder()` - Add multiple equipment with primary designation
   - âœ… `removeEquipmentFromWorkOrder()` - Remove equipment (with primary protection)
   - âœ… `setPrimaryEquipment()` - Change primary equipment
   - âœ… `getTeamEquipmentForWorkOrder()` - Get available team equipment for selection
   - âœ… `getWorkOrderEquipmentCount()` - Count linked equipment

4. **PM Services** - `src/services/preventativeMaintenanceService.ts`
   - âœ… `getPMByWorkOrderAndEquipment()` - Get PM for specific equipment
   - âœ… `getPMsByWorkOrderId()` - Get all PMs for a work order
   - âœ… `createPMsForEquipment()` - Create PM instances for multiple equipment

5. **Hooks** - `src/hooks/useWorkOrderEquipment.ts` & `src/hooks/usePMData.ts`
   - âœ… `useWorkOrderEquipment()` - Query hook for equipment list
   - âœ… `usePrimaryEquipment()` - Query hook for primary equipment
   - âœ… `useTeamEquipmentForWorkOrder()` - Query hook for available equipment
   - âœ… `useAddEquipmentToWorkOrder()` - Mutation hook to add equipment
   - âœ… `useRemoveEquipmentFromWorkOrder()` - Mutation hook to remove equipment
   - âœ… `useSetPrimaryEquipment()` - Mutation hook to set primary

## Remaining Work ðŸ”¨

### Phase 2: UI Components (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### 1. Multi-Equipment Selector for Work Order Form
**File to create:** `src/components/work-orders/form/WorkOrderMultiEquipmentSelector.tsx`
**Requirements:**
- Display after primary equipment is selected
- Filter equipment by same team_id as primary equipment
- Checkbox list with search/filter
- Exclude primary equipment from list
- Show equipment name, model, location
- Visual indicator for selected items

**Implementation:**
```tsx
interface WorkOrderMultiEquipmentSelectorProps {
  primaryEquipmentId: string;
  selectedEquipmentIds: string[];
  onSelectionChange: (equipmentIds: string[]) => void;
  teamId: string;
}
```

#### 2. Update WorkOrderForm Integration
**File to modify:** `src/hooks/useWorkOrderForm.ts`
- Add `equipmentIds: z.array(z.string()).min(1)` to schema
- Add `primaryEquipmentId: z.string()` to schema
- Update form validation logic

**File to modify:** `src/components/work-orders/WorkOrderFormEnhanced.tsx`
- Add `<WorkOrderMultiEquipmentSelector>` after equipment selection
- Update form submission to handle multiple equipment

#### 3. Update Work Order Creation Logic
**File to modify:** `src/hooks/useWorkOrderCreationEnhanced.ts`
- After creating work order, call `addEquipmentToWorkOrder()`
- If `hasPM`, call `createPMsForEquipment()` for all equipment
- Update error handling for multi-equipment scenarios

---

### Phase 3: Work Order Details Page (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### 4. Equipment Selector Component
**File to create:** `src/components/work-orders/WorkOrderEquipmentSelector.tsx`
**Requirements:**
- Dropdown/tabs showing all linked equipment
- Display equipment name with primary badge
- onChange callback to switch selected equipment
- Show count: "Equipment (3)"

**Implementation:**
```tsx
interface WorkOrderEquipmentSelectorProps {
  workOrderId: string;
  selectedEquipmentId: string;
  onEquipmentChange: (equipmentId: string) => void;
}
```

#### 5. Update WorkOrderDetails Page
**File to modify:** `src/pages/WorkOrderDetails.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Add state: `const [selectedEquipmentId, setSelectedEquipmentId] = useState(workOrder?.equipment_id)`
- Use `useWorkOrderEquipment(workOrderId)` to fetch linked equipment
- Add `<WorkOrderEquipmentSelector>` component above `<WorkOrderDetailsInfo>`
- Update equipment display based on `selectedEquipmentId`

#### 6. Update PM Display to be Equipment-Aware
**File to modify:** `src/hooks/useWorkOrderDetailsData.ts`
**Changes:**
- Add `selectedEquipmentId` parameter
- Change PM query from `usePMByWorkOrderId` to `usePMByWorkOrderAndEquipment(workOrderId, selectedEquipmentId)`
- Return selected equipment data

**File to modify:** `src/pages/WorkOrderDetails.tsx` (PM Component)
**Changes:**
- Pass `key={selectedEquipmentId}` to `<PMChecklistComponent>` to force re-render
- Update PM hooks to use selected equipment

---

### Phase 4: Query Updates (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

#### 7. Update Work Order Queries
**Files to modify:**
- `src/services/workOrderDataService.ts` - Add join to fetch equipment list
- `src/services/optimizedWorkOrderService.ts` - Include equipment in queries
- `src/services/teamBasedWorkOrderService.ts` - Update for multi-equipment

**Query Pattern:**
```typescript
.select(`
  *,
  work_order_equipment (
    equipment_id,
    is_primary,
    equipment:equipment_id (
      id, name, manufacturer, model, team_id
    )
  )
`)
```

---

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

#### 8. Create Validation Tests
**File to create:** `src/tests/workOrderEquipment.test.ts`
**Test Cases:**
- âœ… Verify all existing work orders have entries in join table
- âœ… Verify primary equipment matches legacy equipment_id
- âœ… Test adding multiple equipment to work order
- âœ… Test PM creation for multiple equipment
- âœ… Test equipment selector filtering by team
- âœ… Test primary equipment designation
- âœ… Test removing equipment (not primary)
- âœ… Test removing primary equipment (should fail if others exist)

#### 9. Integration Testing
- Test creating new multi-equipment work order
- Test viewing work order details and switching equipment
- Test PM checklist updates for different equipment
- Test completing PM for one equipment (verify doesn't affect others)
- Test legacy single-equipment work orders still work

## Files Created
- âœ… `supabase/migrations/20251027205400_add_multi_equipment_work_orders.sql`
- âœ… `src/types/workOrderEquipment.ts`
- âœ… `src/services/workOrderEquipmentService.ts`
- âœ… `src/hooks/useWorkOrderEquipment.ts`

## Files Modified
- âœ… `src/services/preventativeMaintenanceService.ts` - Added multi-equipment PM functions
- âœ… `src/hooks/usePMData.ts` - Added multi-equipment PM hooks

## Files To Create
- `src/components/work-orders/form/WorkOrderMultiEquipmentSelector.tsx`
- `src/components/work-orders/WorkOrderEquipmentSelector.tsx`
- `src/tests/workOrderEquipment.test.ts`

## Files To Modify
- `src/hooks/useWorkOrderForm.ts`
- `src/components/work-orders/WorkOrderFormEnhanced.tsx`
- `src/hooks/useWorkOrderCreationEnhanced.ts`
- `src/pages/WorkOrderDetails.tsx`
- `src/hooks/useWorkOrderDetailsData.ts`
- `src/services/workOrderDataService.ts`
- `src/services/optimizedWorkOrderService.ts`
- `src/services/teamBasedWorkOrderService.ts`

---

## Backward Compatibility

### Maintained:
- âœ… `work_orders.equipment_id` column preserved with deprecation comment
- âœ… Trigger keeps `equipment_id` in sync with primary equipment
- âœ… All 35 existing work orders backfilled into join table
- âœ… Legacy `getPMByWorkOrderId()` still works (returns first PM)
- âœ… Existing work order queries continue to function

### Migration Safety:
- âœ… No breaking changes to existing functionality
- âœ… RLS policies applied to new table
- âœ… Foreign key constraints with CASCADE delete
- âœ… Data integrity maintained via unique constraint
- âœ… Primary equipment enforcement via database trigger

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation, execute in this order:

1. **Create `WorkOrderMultiEquipmentSelector` component**
2. **Update `WorkOrderFormEnhanced` to include multi-equipment selection**
3. **Modify `useWorkOrderCreationEnhanced` to create join table entries + PMs**
4. **Create `WorkOrderEquipmentSelector` for details page**
5. **Update `WorkOrderDetails` page with equipment switching**
6. **Update PM display logic to be equipment-aware**
7. **Test end-to-end flow**
8. **Update documentation**

**Estimated remaining time:** 2-3 hours for UI components + testing

---

## Database Verification

Run these queries in Supabase to verify:

```sql
-- Verify all work orders are in join table
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM work_orders WHERE equipment_id IS NOT NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM work_order_equipment WHERE is_primary = true;
-- These should match (currently: 35)

-- Verify primary equipment sync
SELECT wo.id, wo.equipment_id as legacy_eq, woe.equipment_id as join_eq
FROM work_orders wo
LEFT JOIN work_order_equipment woe ON wo.id = woe.work_order_id AND woe.is_primary = true
WHERE wo.equipment_id IS NOT NULL AND wo.equipment_id != woe.equipment_id;
-- Should return 0 rows

-- Test trigger (will update work_orders.equipment_id)
UPDATE work_order_equipment 
SET is_primary = true 
WHERE id = '<some-id>';
```

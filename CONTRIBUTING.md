## Project Overview

EquipQR is a comprehensive fleet equipment management platform built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase. The application helps organizations track equipment, manage work orders, and coordinate maintenance teams.

**Key Technologies:**
- Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- State: TanStack Query
- Testing: Vitest, React Testing Library

## Branching Model

EquipQR uses a three-branch strategy to maintain code quality and controlled releases:

### Branch Environments

| Branch | Purpose | Deployment | Public URL |
|--------|---------|------------|------------|
| `dev` | Active development | None (local only) | N/A |
| `preview` | Staging/testing | Auto-deploy on merge | preview.equipqr.app |
| `main` | Production | Auto-deploy on merge | equipqr.app |

### Branch Flow

1. **Development** (`dev` branch)
   - All feature development happens here
   - Push to `origin/dev` for backup
   - No public deployment

2. **Staging** (`preview` branch)
   - Merge `dev` → `preview` via Pull Request
   - Triggers CI checks
   - Deploys to preview.equipqr.app for user testing

3. **Production** (`main` branch)
   - Merge `preview` → `main` via Pull Request
   - Triggers strict CI checks
   - Deploys to equipqr.app (production)

4. **Hotfixes** (direct to `main`)
   - Emergency fixes can go directly to `main`
   - Should be rare; prefer the normal flow

**Note**: Versions are created manually using the Manual Version Bump workflow after deployments are verified, not automatically on merge.

## Versioning & Release Process

EquipQR uses **manual semantic versioning** with git tags and GitHub releases.

### How It Works

Versions are created manually by maintainers through a GitHub Actions workflow:

1. **Navigate to the workflow**:
   - Go to **Actions** → **Manual Version Bump**
   - Click **Run workflow**
   - Select the branch (typically `main` or `preview`)

2. **Enter version information**:
   - **Version**: Enter the new version number (e.g., `1.2.3` - without `v` prefix)
   - **Message**: Optional release message (defaults to "Release vX.Y.Z")
   - The workflow displays current version and suggested bumps in the job summary

3. **Workflow automatically**:
   - Validates version format
   - Checks if tag already exists
   - Updates `package.json` with new version
   - Commits the change: `chore: bump version to X.Y.Z`
   - Creates git tag: `vX.Y.Z`
   - Pushes commit and tag to the repository
   - Creates GitHub Release with auto-generated notes
   - Triggers deployment with the new version

### Semantic Versioning Guidelines

Follow semantic versioning principles when choosing version numbers:

- **Major** (X.0.0): Breaking changes, significant new features
  - Example: `1.5.3` → `2.0.0`
- **Minor** (X.Y.0): New features, backward-compatible changes
  - Example: `1.5.3` → `1.6.0`
- **Patch** (X.Y.Z): Bug fixes, minor improvements
  - Example: `1.5.3` → `1.5.4`

### Version Display

The application displays the current version in the footer:
- Local development: `vdev`
- Deployed environments: Shows the version from the latest git tag (e.g., `v1.2.3`)

### Rollback

If a version is created incorrectly:

```bash
# Delete tag locally and remotely
git tag -d vX.Y.Z
git push origin --delete vX.Y.Z

# Delete GitHub Release via GitHub UI (Releases → Delete)

# Revert package.json commit if needed
git revert <commit-sha>
git push origin <branch>
```

### Reference Documentation

For technical details, see [`docs/deployment/versioning-system.md`](./docs/deployment/versioning-system.md).

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Columbia-Cloudworks-LLC/EquipQR.git
   cd EquipQR
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Copy `env.example` to `.env`
   - Fill in required values (see [README.md](./README.md))

4. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Making Changes

1. Work on the `dev` branch
2. Follow the coding guidelines below
3. Write tests for new features
4. Run linting and tests before pushing:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run type-check
   npm run test
   ```

### Pushing Your Work

```bash
# Push to dev for backup
git push origin dev

# When ready for staging, open PR to preview
# Use GitHub UI or:
gh pr create --base preview --head dev --title "Your feature description"
```

## CI/CD Policy

### Preview Branch (`preview`)

**On Pull Requests** (e.g., `dev` → `preview`):
- ✅ Linting (ESLint)
- ✅ Type checking (TypeScript)
- ✅ Unit tests with coverage
- ✅ Build validation
- ✅ Security scan (npm audit)

### Main Branch (`main`)

**Strict Requirements**:
- ✅ All CI checks must pass
- ✅ Preview deployment must be successful
- ✅ At least 1 maintainer review
- ✅ No force pushes or deletions

## Reporting Issues

We welcome bug reports, feature requests, and questions!

## Support Contact

### For Customers

If you're a EquipQR customer experiencing issues or need support:

**Email**: [nicholas.king@columbiacloudworks.com](mailto:nicholas.king@columbiacloudworks.com)

Please include:
- Your organization name
- Description of the issue
- Any error messages or screenshots
- Urgency level (critical, high, normal, low)

### For General Bugs/Features

Please use GitHub Issues for:
- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- General questions about the codebase

This helps maintain a public record and benefits the entire community.

## Coding Guidelines

EquipQR follows strict coding standards to maintain quality and consistency.

### Language & Style

- **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for all new code
- **Strict Mode**: Enable strict type checking
- **No `any`**: Avoid `any` type; use proper types or `unknown`
- **ESLint**: Follow the project's ESLint configuration
- **Formatting**: Code is auto-formatted (handled by tooling)

### Architecture Patterns

Follow the patterns documented in [`docs/architecture/`](./docs/architecture/):

1. **Component Hierarchy**:
   - Pages: `src/pages/` (route-level, <300 LOC)
   - Features: `src/components/[feature]/` (e.g., `equipment/`, `work-orders/`)
   - UI Primitives: `src/components/ui/` (shadcn-style, no business logic)

2. **Data Patterns**:
   - Custom Hooks: `src/hooks/` for data fetching (TanStack Query)
   - Services: `src/services/` for business logic (stateless)
   - Contexts: `src/contexts/` for global state (Auth, Organization, Settings)

3. **File Naming**:
   - Components: PascalCase (e.g., `EquipmentList.tsx`)
   - Files/folders: kebab-case (e.g., `equipment-list.tsx`)
   - Hooks: `use` prefix (e.g., `useEquipment.ts`)

### Multi-Tenancy

**Critical**: Every database query must filter by `organization_id`:

```typescript
// ✅ Correct
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('equipment')
  .select('*')
  .eq('organization_id', orgId);

// ❌ Wrong - security vulnerability!
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('equipment')
  .select('*');
```

### Testing

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Aim for >70% code coverage
- Test critical paths: auth, data mutations, business logic
- Use `@testing-library/react` for component tests
- Mock Supabase calls using test utilities

```bash
# Run tests
npm run test

# With coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Update relevant docs in `docs/` for major changes
- Include inline comments for complex logic
- Reference architecture docs when applicable

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Before Submitting

- [ ] Code follows the style guidelines
- [ ] Tests pass (`npm run test`)
- [ ] Linting passes (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Type checking passes (`npm run type-check`)
- [ ] Build succeeds (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

### PR Structure

**Title**: Use conventional commit format
- `feat: add equipment photo upload`
- `fix: resolve work order assignment bug`
- `docs: update API reference`
- `refactor: simplify auth context`
- `chore: bump version to 1.2.0`

**Description**: Include
- Summary of changes
- Related issue(s): `Fixes #123`, `Relates to #456`
- Testing performed
- Screenshots for UI changes
- Breaking changes (if any)
- Migration steps (if any)

### Size Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused and small (<500 lines changed)
- Break large features into multiple PRs
- Separate refactoring from feature changes
- One concern per PR

### Review Process

1. Create PR from `dev` to `preview` (or `preview` to `main`)
2. CI checks run automatically
3. Address any failing checks
4. Request review from maintainers
5. Make requested changes
6. Maintainer approves and merges
7. Deployment triggered
8. After successful deployment, maintainer manually creates version using the Manual Version Bump workflow

### Merge Strategy

- **Squash and merge** for feature PRs (clean history)

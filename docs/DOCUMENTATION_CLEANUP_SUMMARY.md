## Experimental Validator Removal (Additional Cleanup)

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Commit**: `06ff112`

Removed experimental documentation validation system (47 files total):
- âœ… `.doc-validator/` directory (3 config files)
- âœ… `scripts/doc-validator/` directory (29 TypeScript files + configs)
- âœ… `specs/001-documentation-standards-and/` directory (14 spec files)

## What Remains

### Historical Documentation (Preserved)
The following files in `docs/archive/` contain billing/Stripe references but are intentionally preserved for historical context:
- Various performance fix summaries
- CI migration fixes
- Historical implementation notes

### Migration Documentation (Required)
Migration documentation retains references to billing-related migrations because:
- Historical migrations exist in the database
- Migration files reference billing tables
- Needed for understanding migration history

### Schema Documentation (Required)
Database schema documentation includes deprecated billing tables because:
- Tables still exist in production (with deprecation comments)
- RLS policies reference these tables
- Needed for database maintenance

---

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Repository Root**
   - Removed 14 root-level markdown files
   - Easier to find important documentation
   - Less clutter for new developers

2. **Accurate Documentation**
   - No misleading billing feature references
   - Clear that application is free
   - Updated setup instructions

3. **Better Organization**
   - Historical fixes properly archived
   - Implementation summaries removed after completion
   - Only active/relevant documentation remains

4. **Improved Developer Experience**
   - No confusion about billing features
   - Clearer onboarding process
   - Focused on actual features

---

## Next Steps

### Optional Future Cleanup
Consider reviewing these areas if further cleanup is desired:

1. **Edge Functions Documentation**
   - `docs/deployment/edge-function-secrets.md` - May contain deprecated Stripe references
   - Check if Stripe-related edge functions are documented

2. **System Architecture**
   - `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md` - May reference billing architecture
   - Review for outdated billing system diagrams

3. **Database Schema**
   - `docs/architecture/database-schema.md` - Contains deprecated billing tables
   - Consider adding prominent notes about deprecation

---

## Validation

âœ… All planned cleanup tasks completed  
âœ… Billing references removed from key user-facing documentation  
âœ… Historical context preserved in archives  
âœ… No broken links introduced  
âœ… Git status shows clean changes

## Commit Recommendation

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "docs: clean up outdated documentation and remove billing references

- Remove 13 obsolete root-level implementation summary files
- Remove billing-related documentation (billing-and-pricing.md, billing-exemptions-admin.md)
- Archive historical implementation summaries (multi-equipment, monetization, migration rules)
- Update README.md to remove Stripe/billing references
- Update docs/README.md to remove billing navigation
- Update developer-onboarding.md to remove billing directory reference

# Work Order Workflow Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the complete work order workflow in EquipQR, including creation methods, status management, user permissions, assignment processes, and notification systems. Work orders are the primary mechanism for tracking maintenance and repair activities across the equipment fleet.

## Work Order Lifecycle

### Status Flow

Work orders progress through a defined lifecycle with the following statuses:

1. **Submitted** - Initial state when a work order is created
2. **Accepted** - Work order has been reviewed and approved
3. **Assigned** - Work order has been assigned to a specific technician or team
4. **In Progress** - Active work has begun on the order
5. **On Hold** - Work has been temporarily paused
6. **Completed** - All work has been finished successfully
7. **Cancelled** - Work order has been terminated without completion

### Status Transitions

| Current Status | Possible Next States | Who Can Change | Notes |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------|-------|
| Submitted | Accepted, Cancelled | Manager, Admin, Owner | Initial review stage |
| Accepted | Assigned, Cancelled | Manager, Admin, Owner | Ready for assignment |
| Assigned | In Progress, On Hold, Cancelled | Manager, Admin, Owner, Assigned Technician | Work can begin |
| In Progress | Completed, On Hold, Cancelled | Manager, Admin, Owner, Assigned Technician | Active work phase |
| On Hold | In Progress, Cancelled | Manager, Admin, Owner, Assigned Technician | Resume or terminate |
| Completed | (Final State) | - | Work finished |
| Cancelled | (Final State) | - | Work terminated |

- API endpoints verify authorization before data access

### Audit Trail
- All work order changes are logged with timestamps
- User attribution for all status changes
- Historical data preservation for compliance

## Integration Points

### Equipment Management
- Direct integration with equipment database
- Equipment status updates based on work order status
- QR code scanning for quick work order creation

### Team Management
- Team-based assignment and visibility
- Role-based permission enforcement
- Team workload distribution

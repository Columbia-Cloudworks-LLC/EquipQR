## Issues Discovered

### Critical Issue: Images Not Appearing in Equipment Gallery

**Problem**: Images uploaded through work order notes do not appear in the equipment Images tab.

**Impact**: High - This affects the core functionality described in the user requirements.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Images are successfully uploaded to work orders
- Images are stored in the work-order-images Supabase bucket
- Images are associated with work order notes
- However, the equipment Images tab is not displaying these images

**Potential Causes**:
1. Database query issue in `EquipmentImagesTab` component
2. Missing association between work order images and equipment
3. RLS (Row Level Security) policy preventing image access
4. Image URL generation or storage path issue

**Recommended Fix**:
1. Check the `getEquipmentImages` function in `equipmentImagesService.ts`
2. Verify the database query includes work order images
3. Ensure proper image URL generation
4. Test RLS policies for image access

### Documentation Updates
1. Add troubleshooting section for image gallery issues
2. Include workaround instructions for viewing work order images
3. Update screenshots once the issue is resolved

### Future Testing
1. Test image upload through equipment notes (direct method)
2. Test setting display images from work order images
3. Test image deletion and management
4. Test mobile interface image upload

## Conclusion

The image upload functionality works correctly for work orders, but there is a critical issue preventing images from appearing in the equipment Images tab. This needs to be resolved before the documentation can be considered complete for end users.

**Overall Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS - Core functionality works but critical display issue exists

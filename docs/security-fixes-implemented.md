# Security Fixes Implemented

This document tracks security vulnerabilities that have been identified and resolved in the EquipQR project.

## Critical Security Issues Resolved

### 1. Organization Members Table Public Access Vulnerability (Fixed: 2025-09-03)

**Issue**: The `organization_members` table was publicly readable, containing sensitive organizational structure data including user IDs, organization IDs, roles, and membership status. Attackers could map out company hierarchies and identify high-value targets like owners and admins.

**Risk Level**: Critical - PUBLIC_ORGANIZATION_MEMBERS

**Root Cause**: The SELECT policy on `organization_members` table used `USING (true)`, which allowed unrestricted public access to all organization member data regardless of authentication status or organization membership.

**Fix Applied**:
- **Migration**: `20250903190521_fix_organization_members_security.sql`
- **Action**: Replaced the insecure `organization_members_select` policy with `organization_members_select_secure`
- **New Policy**: Restricts SELECT access to only authenticated users who can only see members within their own organizations

**Technical Details**:
```sql
-- Old vulnerable policy (removed)
CREATE POLICY "organization_members_select" ON "public"."organization_members" 
FOR SELECT TO public USING (true);

-- New secure policy (implemented)
CREATE POLICY "organization_members_select_secure" ON "public"."organization_members" 
FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM "public"."organization_members" "user_org"
    WHERE "user_org"."user_id" = (SELECT "auth"."uid"())
      AND "user_org"."organization_id" = "organization_members"."organization_id"
      AND "user_org"."status" = 'active'
  )
);
```

**Verification**: 
- ✅ RLS is enabled on the table
- ✅ SELECT policy now restricts access to authenticated users only
- ✅ Users can only access organization members within their own organizations
- ✅ No unauthorized access to organizational structure data

**Impact**: This fix prevents potential data breaches where attackers could:
- Map out company organizational structures
- Identify high-value targets (owners, admins)
- Access sensitive membership information across organizations
- Perform reconnaissance for targeted attacks

## Security Best Practices Applied

1. **Row Level Security (RLS)**: All policies now follow the principle of least privilege
2. **Authentication Requirements**: Sensitive operations require authenticated users
3. **Organization Scoping**: Access is properly scoped to user's own organization
4. **Documentation**: All security fixes are documented with clear explanations
5. **Migration Tracking**: All changes are tracked through versioned migrations

## Compliance Notes

This fix addresses requirements for:
- Data privacy and access control
- Organizational data protection
- Prevention of unauthorized information disclosure
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) enforcement

## Next Steps

- Monitor for any application functionality that may be affected by the stricter access controls
- Review other tables for similar vulnerabilities
- Implement regular security audits using Supabase Security Advisor
- Consider implementing additional logging for sensitive operations

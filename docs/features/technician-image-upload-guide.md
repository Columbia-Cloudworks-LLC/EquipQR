## Best Practices for Image Documentation

### What to Photograph

- **Before Work**: Document the initial condition, damage, or issue
- **During Work**: Show parts being replaced, tools used, or work in progress
- **After Work**: Document the completed repair or maintenance
- **Parts**: Photograph part numbers, serial numbers, or model information
- **Safety Issues**: Document any safety concerns or hazards found

### Image Quality Tips

- **Good Lighting**: Ensure adequate lighting for clear photos
- **Stable Shots**: Hold the camera steady or use a tripod
- **Multiple Angles**: Take photos from different angles when documenting damage
- **Close-ups**: Get detailed shots of specific issues or parts
- **Wide Shots**: Include context shots showing the overall area

### File Management

- **File Size**: Keep images under 10MB each for faster upload
- **File Names**: Use descriptive names if possible (e.g., "left-track-damage.jpg")
- **Multiple Images**: Upload multiple images in a single note for related work

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Image Won't Upload**
- Check file size (must be under 10MB)
- Verify file format (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP only)
- Ensure stable internet connection

**Images Not Appearing**
- Refresh the page and check again
- Verify the note was created successfully
- Check if images are still processing

**Poor Image Quality**
- Ensure adequate lighting
- Clean camera lens
- Hold device steady while taking photos

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try uploading a smaller image file
3. Contact your supervisor or IT support
4. Check the EquipQR help documentation

## Security and Privacy

- **Private Notes**: Use the "Private Note" toggle for sensitive information
- **Image Content**: Ensure images don't contain sensitive personal information
- **Company Policy**: Follow your organization's image and documentation policies

## Summary

Uploading images to equipment records through work orders provides:

- **Complete Documentation**: Visual record of work performed
- **Progress Tracking**: Before, during, and after photos
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Other technicians can see previous work
- **Quality Assurance**: Supervisors can review work quality
- **Compliance**: Meets documentation requirements for maintenance records

# Vercel-GitHub Integration Setup

This guide explains how to properly configure the integration between Vercel and GitHub to resolve deployment status issues.

## Current Issue Resolution

The error "Missing successful active Preview deployment" and "Environment Variable VITE_APP_VERSION references Secret vite_app_version, which does not exist" have been resolved by:

1. **Removing problematic environment variable references** from `vercel.json`
2. **Simplifying deployment workflows** to avoid conflicts with Vercel's built-in integration
3. **Using Vercel's native GitHub integration** instead of custom deployment scripts

## Solution: Simplified Vercel Integration

### Step 1: Vercel Dashboard Configuration

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Navigate to your project settings
   - Go to "Git" section
   - Ensure GitHub integration is properly connected
   - Enable "GitHub Deployments" in integration settings

2. **Configure Branch Mappings:**
   - `main` branch → Production (equipqr.app)
   - `preview` branch → Preview (preview.equipqr.app)

3. **Set Environment Variables in Vercel:**
   - Go to Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add `VITE_APP_VERSION` as a regular environment variable
   - Set value to `dev` (or leave empty for automatic detection)

### Step 2: GitHub Repository Configuration

1. **Branch Protection Rules:**
   - Go to Settings → Branches
   - Edit protection rule for `main` branch
   - Under "Required status checks":
     - ✅ Keep: "Security Scan", "Test Suite", "Quality Gates"
     - ❌ Remove: "Deploy to Vercel" (if present)
     - ❌ Remove: "Require deployments" (if causing issues)

2. **Required Status Checks:**
   - Continuous Integration / Security Scan (pull_request) ✅
   - Continuous Integration / Test Suite (18.x) (pull_request) ✅
   - Continuous Integration / Test Suite (20.x) (pull_request) ✅
   - Continuous Integration / Quality Gates ✅

### Step 3: Workflow Configuration

The following workflows are now configured:

#### `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Purpose**: Notification-only workflow
- **Triggers**: Push to main/preview branches
- **Function**: Reports deployment status without interfering with Vercel
- **No Secrets Required**: Works without Vercel API tokens

#### `.github/workflows/deployment-status.yml`
- **Purpose**: Handles deployment status events
- **Triggers**: Vercel deployment status updates
- **Function**: Reports deployment success/failure to GitHub

#### `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **Purpose**: Core CI pipeline (unchanged)
- **Function**: Linting, testing, security scanning, quality gates

## How It Works Now

### Deployment Flow:
1. **Push to branch** → Triggers CI workflows
2. **CI passes** → Vercel automatically deploys (built-in integration)
3. **Vercel deployment** → Reports status back to GitHub
4. **GitHub receives status** → Updates PR checks
5. **All checks pass** → PR can be merged

### Version Control Flow:
1. **PR merged** → Versioning workflow creates new tag
2. **New tag created** → CI workflow detects version during build
3. **Version displayed** → App shows current version in footer

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment status still shows as missing:
1. **Check Vercel Integration:**
   - Verify GitHub integration is connected in Vercel dashboard
   - Ensure "GitHub Deployments" is enabled
   - Check that branch mappings are correct

2. **Check Branch Protection:**
   - Remove "Require deployments" from branch protection rules
   - Ensure only essential CI checks are required

3. **Check Environment Variables:**
   - Verify `VITE_APP_VERSION` is set in Vercel dashboard
   - Don't reference non-existent secrets in `vercel.json`

### If version increment doesn't work:
1. **Check Versioning Workflow:**
   - Ensure `.github/workflows/versioning.yml` has `contents: write` permission
   - Verify the merge is happening to the correct target branch
   - Check that tags are being created successfully

2. **Check Version Display:**
   - Verify `VITE_APP_VERSION` environment variable is accessible
   - Check that the version is being derived correctly in CI

## Current Configuration Summary

### Files Modified:
- ✅ `vercel.json` - Removed problematic environment variable references
- ✅ `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Simplified to notification-only
- ✅ `.github/workflows/deployment-status.yml` - Handles status reporting
- ✅ `docs/deployment/vercel-github-integration.md` - This updated guide

### Branch Protection Settings:
- ✅ Require signed commits: **DISABLED**
- ✅ Require status checks: **ENABLED** (CI workflows only)
- ✅ Require deployments: **DISABLED** (using Vercel's built-in integration)

### Deployment URLs:
- **Production**: `equipqr.app` (main branch)
- **Preview**: `preview.equipqr.app` (preview branch)

## Next Steps

1. **Update your PR branch** with the latest changes from preview
2. **Verify CI checks pass** with the new configuration
3. **Check Vercel deployment** triggers automatically
4. **Merge PR** when all checks are green
5. **Verify version increment** works correctly

The deployment issues should now be resolved, and your PR should be able to merge successfully.

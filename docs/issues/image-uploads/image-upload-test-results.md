## Expected Behavior

2. **Upload Interface**: 
   - Drag & drop functionality
   - File picker button
   - Support for JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP formats
   - 10MB file size limit per image
   - Maximum 5 files per upload
   - Preview of selected images before upload
3. **Upload Process**:
   - Images uploaded to Supabase Storage bucket `equipment-note-images`
   - File path structure: `{userId}/{equipmentId}/{noteId}/{timestamp}.{extension}`
   - Images associated with equipment notes, not directly with equipment
   - Database record created in `equipment_note_images` table
4. **Display**:
   - Images appear in both "Notes" and "Images" tabs
   - Images can be set as equipment's display image
   - Images can be deleted (with proper permissions)
   - Images show metadata (upload date, uploader, file size, description)

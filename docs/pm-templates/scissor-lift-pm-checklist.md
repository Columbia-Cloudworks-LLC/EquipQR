## 1. Visual Inspection

### Item 1: General Condition and Leaks
**Description:** Walk around the scissor lift and inspect for any obvious damage or deformities in the structure. Look underneath for any oil or hydraulic fluid leaks on the ground or dripping from the machine (hydraulic hoses, motors, or cylinder areas). Ensure the machine is relatively clean so that components are visible.

### Item 2: Decals and Operational Labels
**Description:** Verify that all safety decals, warning labels, and operational instruction placards (including capacity charts) are present and legible. Replace any missing or illegible decals to maintain safety information on the lift.

### Item 3: Guardrails and Structure
**Description:** Check that all guardrails are in place, properly secured with pins or fasteners, and not bent or damaged. Ensure the scissor stack (lifting arms) is straight and free of obvious cracks or excessive wear at pivot points. Inspect the base frame for any cracks, particularly near welds or high-stress areas.

### Item 4: Battery and Fluid Trays
**Description:** If the unit is battery powered, open the battery compartment tray and ensure there are no spilled electrolytes or corrosion buildup outside the batteries. If engine-powered, inspect the engine tray or compartment for accumulated debris, oil, or fuel residue.

### Item 5: Wheels and Casters (Initial Check)
**Description:** Visually inspect the wheels and tires for any cuts, chunks missing, or signs of flat spots. Ensure that all wheel nuts are present. Note if tires are pneumatic (check for proper inflation later) or solid rubber; they should not be excessively worn or damaged.

### Item 6: Outriggers or Pothole Protection (if equipped)
**Description:** If the lift has outriggers or stabilizers, ensure they are properly stowed and not damaged. For slab scissors with automatic pothole protection bars, make sure these bars are retracted (flush with chassis) when the machine is lowered and not bent or obstructed.

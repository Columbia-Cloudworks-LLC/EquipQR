## 1. Visual Inspection

### Item 1: Exterior and Undercarriage Overview
**Description:** Walk around the excavator and visually inspect for any obvious damage, loose components, or fluid leaks (oil, hydraulic fluid, coolant). Check that the undercarriage is clear of excessive mud or debris that could hide issues or impede movement.

### Item 2: Safety Decals and Labels
**Description:** Ensure all safety decals, operational labels, and warning signs are present and legible, including load charts (if applicable) and instructional placards.

### Item 3: Swing Bearing and House Swing Area
**Description:** Visually inspect the swing bearing area (where the upper structure meets the undercarriage) for excess grease purging, metal shavings, or debris. Check that the slew ring guard (if present) is secure. Look for any indication of abnormal movement or gaps in the swing bearing.

### Item 4: Boom, Stick, and Attachment Condition
**Description:** Examine the boom and stick (arm) for cracks, dents, or structural damage, especially around welds and connection points. Check the attachment (bucket or other tool) for cracked welds, worn or missing teeth, or damaged cutting edges.

### Item 5: Cylinders and Hoses (External)
**Description:** Inspect all visible hydraulic cylinders (boom lift, arm (stick) cylinder, bucket cylinder, and any auxiliary cylinders) for signs of oil leaks at seals or damage to the rod. Also check exposed hydraulic hoses and tube lines along the boom and stick for cracks, wear, or leaks.

### Item 6: Tracks and Ground Contact
**Description:** Walk around the tracks (or wheels if a wheeled excavator) to check for proper tension and any noticeable damage. Ensure track pads/shoes are secure and not excessively worn or missing bolts. Look for any foreign objects lodged in the tracks or sprockets.

### Item 7: Handrails, Steps, and Guards
**Description:** Verify that all handrails, grab handles, and steps are secure and undamaged. Ensure anti-slip surfaces on steps and the upper structure walkway are in good condition. Check that protective guards and covers (for example, over the swing motor, radiator, etc.) are in place and secure.

### Item 8: Counterweight and Carbody
**Description:** Inspect the counterweight for any damage, cracks, or loose mounting bolts (if removable type). Ensure the carbody (the main lower frame) has no visible structural damage or missing bolts/nuts.

### Item 9: House Slew Limit Stop (if equipped)
**Description:** If the excavator has mechanical swing stops or a house lock (transport pin), verify it is stored properly or engaged only as needed, and check that the mechanism is not damaged.

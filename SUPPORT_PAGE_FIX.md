# Support Page Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary

**Problem**: The `/dashboard/support` route was returning an empty page (blank content area).

**Root Cause**: 
- A public Support component existed at `/support` with landing header/footer
- No dashboard-embedded version existed for `/dashboard/support`
- The route in `App.tsx` was configured but the component didn't exist

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Dashboard Support Component
- **File**: `src/pages/Support.tsx`
- Added `DashboardSupport` export - a dashboard-embedded version without landing header/footer
- Kept existing `Support` component for public access at `/support`

### 2. Updated App.tsx Routing
- **File**: `src/App.tsx`
- Added lazy import for `DashboardSupport` component (line 34):
  ```typescript
  const DashboardSupport = lazy(() => import('@/pages/Support').then(module => ({ default: module.DashboardSupport })));
  ```
- Added route at `/dashboard/support` (line 165):
  ```typescript
  <Route path="/support" element={<DashboardSupport />} />
  ```

### 3. Component Differences

**Public Support (`/support`)**:
- Includes `LandingHeader` component
- Includes `LegalFooter` component
- Has "Start Free Trial" CTA for public users
- Full-screen layout

**Dashboard Support (`/dashboard/support`)**:
- Embedded within dashboard layout
- No header/footer (uses dashboard's)
- Content-only with FAQ, contact info, and best practices
- Uses `space-y-6` for spacing (standard dashboard pattern)

## Files Modified

1. `src/pages/Support.tsx` - Added `DashboardSupport` export
2. `src/App.tsx` - Added route and lazy import for `DashboardSupport`

## Testing

The fix has been tested locally and builds successfully. The changes need to be deployed to see them on the live site at https://equipqr.app/dashboard/support.

## Expected Behavior After Deployment

- Navigate to `/dashboard/support` from within the app
- See support documentation with:
  - Contact information
  - FAQ accordion
  - Role-based instructions (Admin vs Technician)
  - Best practices section
- All content displays within the dashboard layout (sidebar, topbar, footer)

## Navigation

Users can access the support page via:
1. User dropdown menu in sidebar â†’ "Support" link
2. Direct URL: `/dashboard/support`

# Specification Quality Checklist: Documentation Standards and Quality Assurance System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 28, 2025  
**Feature**: [../spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **PASS**: Specification focuses on what users need (documentation maintainers, developers, consumers) without prescribing specific tools or technologies. All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are present and complete.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **PASS**: All 31 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. Success criteria include specific metrics (90% quality score, 60% reduction in questions, 40% faster onboarding, 50% faster PR reviews, 100% coverage targets). Edge cases address boundaries, errors, security, and observability.

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **PASS**: All 5 user stories are independently testable with clear acceptance scenarios. Each story has explicit priority (P1-P3) and rationale. Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (focused on outcomes like "quality score", "sync issues detected", "onboarding time reduced" rather than implementation specifics).

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- All checklist items pass validation
- No critical gaps or ambiguities identified
- Strong traceability between user stories, functional requirements, and success criteria
- Clear scope boundaries with explicit out-of-scope items

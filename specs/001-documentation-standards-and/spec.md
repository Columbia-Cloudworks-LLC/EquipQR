# Feature Specification: Documentation Standards and Quality Assurance System

**Feature Branch**: `001-documentation-standards-and`  
**Created**: October 28, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Documentation Standards and Quality Assurance System based on comprehensive audit checklist"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-28

- Q: Should documentation validation issues block PR merges, or serve as advisory warnings? → A: Advisory only - All validation issues are warnings; never block merge
- Q: What level of content similarity should trigger a duplication warning? → A: Verbatim paragraphs - Flag when 3+ consecutive sentences are identical across files
- Q: Where does the canonical terminology glossary come from? → A: Maintained file - Manual markdown/YAML file in docs/ that teams edit via PRs
- Q: What is the acceptable execution time for running documentation validation checks? → A: Under 5 minutes for incremental validation (PR context), suitable for CI integration
- Q: How should documentation quality metrics be tracked and reported over time? → A: CI artifacts with JSON - Export JSON reports as build artifacts, optionally post summaries to PRs
- Q: How should external link validation handle rate limiting to avoid triggering API bans or DDoS protections? → A: Conservative rate limiting - Max 1 request per second per domain, with configurable delays
- Q: What mechanism should detect when code changes require documentation updates (schema, API, env vars, file paths, feature flags)? → A: Git diff analysis with pattern matching - Analyze commit diffs for specific patterns and flag related docs
- Q: How should work-in-progress documentation be marked for validation exemptions? → A: Frontmatter metadata field - Use YAML frontmatter like `status: draft` or `wip: true` at the top of markdown files
- Q: How should validation issues be prioritized with different severity levels? → A: Tiered severity based on impact - Critical (broken links, missing required sections), High (sync issues), Medium (formatting), Low (style preferences)
- Q: When should full repository validation run (vs incremental PR validation)? → A: On-demand only - Manual trigger by maintainer for pre-release checks or after major restructuring (single maintainer context)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Documentation Quality Validation (Priority: P1)

As a documentation maintainer, I need to validate that all project documentation meets established quality standards so that developers and stakeholders can rely on accurate, up-to-date information.

**Why this priority**: Core value proposition - ensures documentation accuracy and completeness, directly impacts developer productivity and onboarding success.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running validation checks against existing documentation and verifying that all quality criteria are either met or flagged for correction. Delivers immediate value by identifying documentation gaps and inconsistencies.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** existing documentation files, **When** quality validation runs, **Then** each document is checked against completeness standards (required sections, examples, cross-references)
2. **Given** code changes have been made, **When** validation runs, **Then** affected documentation is identified and flagged if out of sync
3. **Given** a new feature is documented, **When** validation runs, **Then** all mandatory sections are verified present and non-empty
4. **Given** external links exist in documentation, **When** validation runs, **Then** broken or deprecated links are identified
5. **Given** terminology is used inconsistently, **When** validation runs, **Then** conflicts are flagged with suggestions for canonical terms

---

### User Story 2 - Deprecated Content Management (Priority: P2)

As a documentation maintainer, I need to systematically track and archive deprecated features and historical changes so that users understand what has been removed and why, while keeping current documentation clean.

**Why this priority**: Prevents confusion and reduces support burden by clearly communicating what features are no longer available and providing migration paths.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a test deprecated feature entry, verifying it appears in the consolidated deprecation log with all required metadata (date, reason, migration path), and confirming removed references in active documentation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a feature has been removed, **When** deprecation is documented, **Then** a consolidated deprecation log includes the feature name, removal date, reason, and migration path
2. **Given** deprecated feature documentation exists, **When** reorganization occurs, **Then** obsolete docs are moved to archive with clear status markers
3. **Given** multiple historical status documents exist in root directory, **When** consolidation runs, **Then** a unified changelog is created and temporary files are removed
4. **Given** a user searches for a deprecated feature, **When** viewing documentation, **Then** clear indicators show the feature status and point to alternatives

---

### User Story 3 - Documentation Synchronization Monitoring (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I need automated detection of code-documentation drift so that I'm notified when my code changes require documentation updates.

**Why this priority**: Prevents documentation from becoming stale, ensuring long-term accuracy and reducing maintenance burden.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by making a schema change, API modification, or environment variable update, then verifying the system detects the discrepancy and alerts the developer with specific files needing updates.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** database schema changes via migration, **When** sync check runs, **Then** schema documentation is flagged if not updated to match
2. **Given** API endpoints are added/modified, **When** sync check runs, **Then** API reference documentation is verified for accuracy
3. **Given** environment variables change in codebase, **When** sync check runs, **Then** env.example and documentation are checked for consistency
4. **Given** component files are renamed or moved, **When** sync check runs, **Then** documentation references to old paths are identified
5. **Given** feature flags are toggled, **When** sync check runs, **Then** feature documentation status is validated

---

### User Story 4 - Documentation Structure Standards Enforcement (Priority: P3)

As a documentation team lead, I need enforced organizational standards for documentation structure so that all contributors follow consistent patterns and users can easily navigate content.

**Why this priority**: Improves discoverability and maintainability, but can be implemented incrementally after core validation is in place.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating documentation files with various naming patterns and directory structures, then verifying that non-compliant items are flagged with specific guidance on correct patterns.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new documentation file is created, **When** structure validation runs, **Then** file naming conventions (kebab-case, appropriate extension) are enforced
2. **Given** documentation exists in multiple locations, **When** duplication check runs, **Then** identical or overlapping content is identified
3. **Given** documentation subdirectories exist, **When** structure validation runs, **Then** each directory has a clear purpose statement and index
4. **Given** screenshots or diagrams are added, **When** organization check runs, **Then** media files are verified to be in appropriate subdirectories with proper naming
5. **Given** cross-references exist between documents, **When** navigation validation runs, **Then** bidirectional links and "See also" sections are verified

---

### User Story 5 - Accessibility and Consistency Standards (Priority: P3)

As a documentation consumer (including users with accessibility needs), I need documentation that follows accessibility standards and uses consistent terminology so that I can effectively understand and use the system regardless of my abilities.

**Why this priority**: Ensures inclusive access and reduces cognitive load, but lower priority than core accuracy and completeness validation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running accessibility checks on sample documentation, verifying heading hierarchy, alt text presence, and terminology consistency across multiple documents.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** documentation contains images, **When** accessibility check runs, **Then** all images have descriptive alt text
2. **Given** documentation uses headings, **When** structure check runs, **Then** heading hierarchy is properly nested (H1 → H2 → H3 without skips)
3. **Given** documentation uses technical terms, **When** terminology check runs, **Then** terms are used consistently across all documents and match canonical glossary
4. **Given** code examples exist, **When** format check runs, **Then** syntax highlighting, consistent indentation, and proper language tags are verified
5. **Given** tables present data, **When** accessibility check runs, **Then** proper table structure with headers is enforced

---

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when validation runs on a very large documentation set (100+ files)?** System should provide progress indicators and allow incremental validation (completing within 5 minutes for typical PR changes), not require all-or-nothing checks. Full-repository validation is on-demand only (manually triggered by maintainer for pre-release checks or after major restructuring) and may take longer since it includes comprehensive external link validation and complete metrics
- **How does system handle documentation files that are intentionally work-in-progress?** Support YAML frontmatter status markers (`status: draft` or `wip: true`) that exempt files from completeness validation rules while still checking syntax, structure, and accessibility. Files without frontmatter or with `status: complete` receive full validation
- **What if a codebase element is documented in multiple valid locations?** Distinguish between harmful duplication (3+ consecutive verbatim sentences indicating copy-paste) vs intentional cross-referencing (different perspectives, paraphrased explanations, or brief overlapping introductions)
- **How do teams adopt documentation standards when validation is advisory-only?** System should provide quality trend metrics and periodic summary reports to encourage voluntary compliance; team culture and code review practices drive adoption rather than automated enforcement
- **Multi-tenancy consideration**: N/A - this is an internal development tool, not a tenant-facing feature
- **Security consideration**: What if validation scripts have access to sensitive information in documentation? Validation should operate read-only and not expose sensitive data in reports
- **Input validation**: What if documentation contains malformed markdown that breaks parsers? Validation should handle parse errors gracefully and report formatting issues
- **Observability**: How can documentation quality be tracked over time? Metrics should be exported as JSON CI artifacts containing quality score trends, coverage percentage, sync violations count, and timestamped validation results. Teams can analyze these JSON reports to track improvements or integrate with custom dashboards
- **E2E Testing**: Critical validation paths include: running full audit on sample documentation set, detecting known code-doc mismatches, enforcing structure standards on test files
- **MCP Integration**: Supabase validation (schema sync), Vercel validation (deployment docs match actual config), GitKraken validation (branch strategy docs accuracy)
- **External link validation rate limiting**: How to avoid triggering API rate limits or DDoS protections when validating external links? Implement conservative rate limiting with max 1 request per second per domain, with configurable delays. This prevents bans from services like GitHub API, Supabase docs, or other frequently-referenced domains while ensuring validation completes in reasonable time
- **Code-documentation synchronization mechanism**: How does the system detect when code changes require documentation updates? Use git diff analysis with pattern matching to analyze commit diffs for specific patterns (migration files, API routes, env.example changes, file renames, feature flag configs) and flag related documentation files. This approach works well in PR context, completes within performance constraints, and can be incrementally improved with more sophisticated patterns
- **Validation severity assignment**: How should teams prioritize fixing validation issues? Use tiered severity levels based on impact: Critical (broken internal links that prevent navigation, missing required sections that block understanding), High (code-documentation sync issues that mislead users), Medium (formatting inconsistencies and structure violations that reduce readability), Low (style preferences and minor accessibility issues). Teams should address Critical and High issues first, treating severity as guidance rather than rigid enforcement since all validation is advisory
- **Full repository validation cadence**: When should comprehensive full-repository validation run? On-demand only via manual trigger, allowing single maintainer to run comprehensive checks (including external link validation, cross-file consistency, complete metrics) before releases or after major documentation restructuring. Incremental PR validation handles day-to-day quality checks efficiently

- **FR-031**: System MUST allow exemptions for work-in-progress documentation with explicit YAML frontmatter status markers (`status: draft` or `wip: true`), exempting such files from completeness checks while still validating syntax and structure

### Key Entities

- **Documentation File**: Represents a single documentation artifact with attributes: path, type (guide/reference/architecture), status (draft/complete/deprecated) extracted from YAML frontmatter, last updated date, owner. Status is determined by frontmatter fields: `status: draft` or `wip: true` for work-in-progress files
- **Validation Rule**: Represents a specific quality check with attributes: rule ID, category (quality/sync/structure/accessibility), severity (critical/high/medium/low based on impact), description. Severity assignment: Critical for broken links and missing required sections, High for sync issues, Medium for formatting/structure violations, Low for style preferences
- **Validation Result**: Represents outcome of running rules against documentation with attributes: file path, rule ID, status (pass/fail), severity (critical/high/medium/low), specific issue description, suggested fix
- **Metrics Report**: Represents quality metrics exported as JSON CI artifact with attributes: timestamp, overall quality score, category breakdown (quality/sync/structure/accessibility scores), total files checked, total issues found, trend comparison (vs previous run)
- **Deprecation Entry**: Represents a deprecated feature with attributes: feature name, removal date, reason, migration path, affected documentation files

## Assumptions

- Documentation is primarily in Markdown format
- Documentation follows a defined directory structure (docs/architecture, docs/features, docs/deployment, etc.)
- Version control (Git) is used for documentation tracking
- Pull request workflow exists for code and documentation changes
- Automated CI/CD pipeline can be extended with documentation validation steps
- Documentation templates exist or will be created for each document type
- Single maintainer context: full repository validation is on-demand rather than scheduled, triggered manually for pre-release checks or after major restructuring
- Team has capacity to address validation findings incrementally
- Glossary terms will be maintained collaboratively by the team via a version-controlled file (markdown or YAML format) in the docs/ directory
- Historical status documents in root directory are candidates for consolidation (not actively maintained)
- Deprecated features list is available or can be compiled from git history and team knowledge
- Standard accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA or similar) apply

## Out of Scope

- Real-time collaborative editing of documentation
- Translation/localization of documentation into multiple languages
- Automated generation of documentation from code comments (JSDoc, docstrings, etc.)
- Version-specific documentation hosting (maintaining docs for multiple product versions simultaneously)
- User-facing documentation portal or search interface
- Automated diagram generation from code structure
- Documentation analytics (page views, time on page, user satisfaction surveys)
- Integration with external documentation platforms (ReadTheDocs, GitBook, etc.)
- Spell-checking and grammar validation (assume external tools handle this)
- Legal/compliance review workflows

## Dependencies

- Existing documentation structure and templates
- Access to codebase for synchronization validation (database migrations, API endpoints, environment variables)
- Git history for identifying deprecated features and historical context
- CI/CD pipeline integration points for automated validation
- Canonical terminology glossary file (docs/glossary.md or docs/glossary.yaml) - created and maintained via PR workflow

## Risks

- **Risk**: Initial validation may reveal hundreds of issues, overwhelming the team
  - **Mitigation**: Implement severity levels and allow incremental fixing; start with critical sync issues first
  
- **Risk**: False positives in synchronization detection (e.g., intentionally different naming between code and docs)
  - **Mitigation**: Provide exemption mechanism and iteratively refine detection rules based on feedback
  
- **Risk**: Validation rules become outdated as project evolves
  - **Mitigation**: Treat validation rules as code (version controlled, reviewed, tested)
  
- **Risk**: Team resistance to additional PR requirements
  - **Mitigation**: Ensure validation provides clear, actionable feedback and demonstrable time savings
  
- **Risk**: External link validation may have false positives due to temporary outages
  - **Mitigation**: Retry logic and exemption list for known flaky links

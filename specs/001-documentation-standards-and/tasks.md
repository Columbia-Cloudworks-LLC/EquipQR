# Tasks: Documentation Standards and Quality Assurance System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-documentation-standards-and/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the spec, so test tasks are OPTIONAL and marked as such.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

**Constitution Compliance**: N/A - This is an internal CLI development tool (no multi-tenancy, database, or UI concerns)

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Single project: Files in `scripts/doc-validator/src/`
- Tests in `scripts/doc-validator/tests/`
- Configuration in `.doc-validator/`

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Quality Validation)

```bash
# Launch all validators for User Story 1 together (after foundation):
Task T027: "Implement internal link validator"
Task T028: "Implement required sections validator"
Task T029: "Implement code examples validator"
Task T030: "Implement terminology consistency validator"
Task T031: "Implement vague language detector"

# These can all be developed in parallel by different team members
# They share the same ValidationContext but operate on different rule IDs
```

---

## Parallel Example: All User Stories (After Foundation)

```bash
# With a team of 5 developers, after Phase 2 completes:
Developer A: Phase 3 (User Story 1 - Quality Validation)
Developer B: Phase 4 (User Story 2 - Deprecation Management)
Developer C: Phase 5 (User Story 3 - Sync Monitoring)
Developer D: Phase 6 (User Story 4 - Structure Standards)
Developer E: Phase 7 (User Story 5 - Accessibility Standards)

# All stories complete and integrate independently
# Each delivers value without breaking others
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only) - Recommended for Single Developer

1. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 1: Setup (~2 hours)
2. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 2: Foundational (~4-6 hours, CRITICAL)
3. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - Quality Validation (~6-8 hours)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo: Show working documentation validation with quality checks
6. **Result**: Functional MVP with immediate value (quality validation)

**Estimated MVP Time**: 12-16 hours of focused development

### Incremental Delivery (Recommended Sequence)

1. Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready (~6-8 hours)
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!) (~6-8 hours)
3. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Sync detection!) (~6-8 hours)
4. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Deprecation management!) (~4-6 hours)
5. Add CI Integration (Phase 8) ‚Üí Automated PR feedback! (~3-4 hours)
6. Add User Stories 4 & 5 as time allows ‚Üí Complete feature (~8-10 hours)
7. Polish (Phase 9) ‚Üí Production ready (~4-6 hours)

**Total Estimated Time**: 37-50 hours

### Parallel Team Strategy (If Multiple Developers Available)

With 2-3 developers:

1. **Team**: Complete Setup + Foundational together (~6-8 hours)
2. **Once Foundational done**:
   - Developer 1: User Story 1 (Quality Validation)
   - Developer 2: User Story 3 (Sync Monitoring)
   - Developer 3 (if available): User Story 2 (Deprecation Management)
3. **After core stories done**:
   - Developer 1: CI Integration (Phase 8)
   - Developer 2: User Story 4 (Structure Standards)
   - Developer 3: User Story 5 (Accessibility Standards)
4. **Final**: Polish together (Phase 9)

**Parallel Time**: ~20-25 hours with 2-3 developers

## Success Criteria Mapping

Each user story maps to specific success criteria from spec.md:

**User Story 1 (Quality Validation)**:
- SC-001: Documentation quality score ‚â•90%
- SC-007: Internal link breakage rate = 0%
- SC-008: External link availability ‚â•95%
- SC-013: Incremental validation <5 minutes

**User Story 2 (Deprecation Management)**:
- SC-003: Zero root-level status documents
- SC-004: All deprecated features documented (100% coverage)

**User Story 3 (Sync Monitoring)**:
- SC-002: Sync issues detected within 24 hours
- SC-012: Review time reduced by 50%

**User Story 4 (Structure Standards)**:
- SC-005: Structure violations = 0
- SC-009: New features 100% documented

**User Story 5 (Accessibility Standards)**:
- SC-006: All images have alt text (100%)
- SC-010: Developer questions reduced by 60%
- SC-011: Onboarding time reduced by 40%

**Cross-Cutting**:
- SC-014: Quality metrics JSON for 100% of CI runs

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies between them
- [Story] label (US1-US5) maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- Tests are OPTIONAL - include only if team wants TDD approach
- Commit after each task or logical group for easy rollback
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Advisory-only approach: Never fail builds, always warn
- Focus on actionable feedback with suggested fixes
- Severity guides prioritization: Critical ‚Üí High ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí Low

## Suggested MVP Scope

**Minimum Viable Product = User Story 1 Only**

Implement through Phase 3 (tasks T001-T036) for:
- ‚úÖ Internal link validation (critical issues)
- ‚úÖ Required sections validation (completeness)
- ‚úÖ Code examples validation (API/guide quality)
- ‚úÖ Terminology consistency (glossary-based)
- ‚úÖ External link validation (with rate limiting)
- ‚úÖ Basic CLI with --incremental flag
- ‚úÖ JSON and console reporting

**Delivers immediate value**: Catches broken links, missing docs, inconsistent terminology

**Time estimate**: 12-16 hours for single developer

**Future phases**: Add sync monitoring (US3), then deprecation (US2), then polish (structure, accessibility, CI integration)

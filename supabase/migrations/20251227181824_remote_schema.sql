-- Migration: remote_schema
-- This migration was previously applied to the database and then the file was deleted.
-- This is a placeholder file to sync local migrations with the remote database state.
-- The actual schema changes from this migration are already present in the database.
--
-- DO NOT modify this file - it exists only to match production state and prevent
-- "Remote migration versions not found in local migrations directory" errors.
--
-- Original migration was generated via Supabase remote schema pull and contained
-- function definitions and schema changes that are now part of the base schema.

-- No-op: migration already applied

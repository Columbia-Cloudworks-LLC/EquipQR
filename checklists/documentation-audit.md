# Documentation Audit Checklist

## Purpose

This checklist validates the quality, completeness, and consistency of documentation requirements for EquipQR. It ensures that documentation standards are clearly defined, processes are documented, and content remains synchronized with the actual codebase.

**Created**: October 28, 2025  
**Focus Areas**: All documentation (architecture, features, deployment, getting-started, how-to, maintenance)  
**Depth Level**: Comprehensive  
**Audience**: Documentation maintainers, developers, technical writers

## Scope

- ✅ Comprehensive audit of all documentation areas
- ✅ Create consolidated DEPRECATIONS.md for all removed features
- ✅ Consolidate root-level status documents into CHANGELOG.md

### Critical Findings

**🔴 CONFLICTS (Must Address)**:

- CHK021: README.md still lists Stripe as optional feature despite billing removal
- CHK023: billing-and-pricing.md and billing-exemptions-admin.md still active despite feature removal
- CHK047: technician-image-upload-guide.md duplicated in docs/features/ and docs/how-to/image-upload/
- CHK054: Document status table lists billing docs as "Complete" despite feature removal
- CHK126-129: Multiple Stripe/billing references remain in README.md

**🟡 GAPS (High Priority)**:

- CHK031, CHK041, CHK136: No DEPRECATIONS.md or CHANGELOG.md consolidating status docs
- CHK044: 15+ root-level status .md files unconsolidated (BILLING_MIGRATION_FIX.md, etc.)
- CHK061: No glossary for EquipQR-specific terms
- CHK076, CHK080: No internal/external link validation process
- CHK086-090: No code-to-documentation sync validation

**✅ STRENGTHS**:

- Environment variable documentation (CHK091-095): Comprehensive and well-structured
- Migration documentation (CHK101-104): Critical rules documented via memory:10414170
- Documentation structure (CHK006-007, CHK051-053): Clear hierarchy and navigation
- Testing requirements (CHK117-118, CHK121-123): Coverage thresholds and CI gates documented

## Next Steps After Checklist Completion

### Immediate (Critical - Address Billing Conflicts)

1. **Remove/Archive Billing Documentation**:
   - Move docs/features/billing-and-pricing.md to docs/archive/deprecated/
   - Move docs/features/billing-exemptions-admin.md to docs/archive/deprecated/
   - Remove billing references from docs/README.md document status table
2. **Update README.md**:
   - Remove or mark deprecated: Stripe setup instructions (§Stripe, §Webhook Configuration)
   - Update External API Requirements section to reflect billing removal
3. **Resolve Duplication**:
   - Remove duplicate docs/features/technician-image-upload-guide.md (keep docs/how-to/image-upload/ version)

### High Priority (Documentation Consolidation)

1. **Create DEPRECATIONS.md** - Consolidate all deprecated feature documentation (billing, etc.)
2. **Create CHANGELOG.md** - Merge all root-level status documents:
   - BILLING_MIGRATION_FIX.md, BILLING_REMOVAL_SUMMARY.md
   - EQUIPMENT_DEDUPLICATION_FIX.md, MIGRATION_ORDER_FIX_COMPLETE.md, MIGRATION_SYNC_FIX.md
   - STORAGE_QUOTA_IMPLEMENTATION.md, MULTI_EQUIPMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
   - FIXES_APPLIED.md, SUPPORT_PAGE_FIX.md, COMMIT_MESSAGE.md, VERSIONING_MIGRATION.md
3. **Archive Root-Level Documents** - Move consolidated status docs to docs/archive/historical-fixes/

### Medium Priority (Fill Gaps)

1. **Create Glossary** - docs/glossary.md with EquipQR-specific terms (organization, equipment, work order, PM, RLS, etc.)
2. **Validation Processes**:
   - Link validation (internal and external)
   - Code-to-doc sync validation (file paths, component names, schema references)
3. **Missing Documentation**:
   - PM (Preventive Maintenance) template feature documentation
   - Multi-equipment work order feature documentation
   - Storage quota enforcement documentation (consolidate STORAGE_QUOTA_IMPLEMENTATION.md)

### Low Priority (Standardization)

1. **Standardize Terminology** - Ensure consistency (work order vs work-order, etc.)
2. **Accessibility Standards** - Define heading hierarchy, alt text, table requirements
3. **Code Example Validation** - Process to validate code examples remain current

```

### **Service Architecture:**
- **BaseService** - Standardized error handling, logging, validation
- **BaseRepository** - Generic CRUD operations with Supabase
- **Domain Services** - Business logic specific to each domain
- **NotesService** - Generic pattern for all note-like entities

### **Hook Architecture:**
- **Hook Factories** - Consistent React Query patterns
- **CRUD Hooks** - Generic patterns for common operations
- **Domain Hooks** - Business-specific functionality
- **Error Handling** - Built-in error management and loading states

---

## 🎯 **SOLID PRINCIPLES IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Single Responsibility Principle (S)**
- Each service class has one clear responsibility
- Hooks are focused on specific data operations
- Types are organized by domain concern
- **Example**: `WorkOrderService` only handles work order business logic

### **Open/Closed Principle (O)**
- Base classes are open for extension, closed for modification
- Hook factories allow easy extension without changing base code
- Service patterns can be extended for new domains
- **Example**: `BaseRepository` can be extended for any entity type

### **Liskov Substitution Principle (L)**
- All services can be substituted with their base classes
- Repository pattern allows different implementations
- Hook factories maintain consistent interfaces
- **Example**: Any service extending `BaseService` can be used interchangeably

### **Interface Segregation Principle (I)**
- Focused, minimal interfaces (BaseEntity, BaseNote, etc.)
- Domain-specific interfaces extend base interfaces
- No client depends on unused methods
- **Example**: `WorkOrderFilters` only contains work order-specific filter options

### **Dependency Inversion Principle (D)**
- Services depend on abstractions (BaseRepository, BaseService)
- Dependency injection through constructor parameters
- High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- **Example**: Services depend on `BaseRepository` interface, not concrete Supabase implementation

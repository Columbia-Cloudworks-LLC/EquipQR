# Versioning System Migration Summary

**Date**: October 25, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… Complete

## Overview

Successfully migrated from automated PR-based versioning to a manual workflow-based versioning system. This simplifies version management and gives maintainers explicit control over when and how versions are created.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Manual Version Workflow
**File**: `.github/workflows/manual-version-bump.yml`

**Key Enhancements**:
- âœ… Accepts version input without `v` prefix (e.g., `1.2.3` instead of `v1.0.0`)
- âœ… Displays current version from git tags in job summary
- âœ… Shows suggested next versions (major/minor/patch)
- âœ… Updates `package.json` version field
- âœ… Commits version change: `chore: bump version to X.Y.Z`
- âœ… Creates annotated git tag `vX.Y.Z`
- âœ… Pushes both commit and tag to repository
- âœ… Creates GitHub Release with auto-generated notes
- âœ… Cross-platform support (Windows PowerShell and Unix bash)

**New Workflow Steps**:
1. Get current version from git tags
2. Compute suggested versions (major/minor/patch)
3. Display version information in job summary
4. Validate version format
5. Check if tag already exists
6. Update package.json
7. Commit the change
8. Create and push annotated tag
9. Create GitHub Release
10. Show recent version tags

### 2. Disabled Automated Versioning
**File**: `.github/workflows/versioning.yml` â†’ `.github/workflows/versioning.yml.disabled`

**Action**: Renamed to disable execution while preserving history

**Reason**: The automated workflow created version bump PRs on every merge, which:
- Created confusing PR chains
- Required manual approval anyway
- Made it unclear when major/minor/patch bumps occurred
- Caused issues with hotfix branches

### 3. Updated Documentation

#### CONTRIBUTING.md
**Section: Versioning & Release Process** (lines 62-125)
- âœ… Replaced automated versioning description with manual workflow guide
- âœ… Added step-by-step instructions for triggering version bumps
- âœ… Added semantic versioning guidelines
- âœ… Added rollback instructions
- âœ… Removed references to version bump PRs

**Section: Branch Flow** (lines 42-61)
- âœ… Removed "Triggers version bump" from branch descriptions
- âœ… Added note that versions are created manually after deployment verification

**Section: CI/CD Policy** (lines 175-192)
- âœ… Removed "Version Bump PRs" subsection
- âœ… Simplified to focus on feature PRs only

**Section: Pull Request Guidelines** (lines 376-389)
- âœ… Updated review process to remove version bump PR steps
- âœ… Simplified merge strategy (removed version bump PR exception)

#### docs/deployment/versioning-system.md
**Complete rewrite to reflect manual workflow**:
- âœ… Updated "How It Works" section with manual workflow steps
- âœ… Added semantic versioning guidelines
- âœ… Expanded rollback instructions
- âœ… Added emergency manual tag creation procedure
- âœ… Added troubleshooting section with common issues
- âœ… Updated file list to reference new workflow

## How to Use the New System

### Creating a Version

1. **Navigate to GitHub Actions**:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click **Actions** tab
   - Select **Manual Version Bump** workflow
   - Click **Run workflow**

2. **Enter Version Details**:
   - **Branch**: Select the branch to tag (usually `main` or `preview`)
   - **Version**: Enter version number without `v` prefix (e.g., `1.2.3`)
   - **Message**: Optional release message (defaults to "Release vX.Y.Z")

3. **Review Job Summary**:
   - Workflow displays current version
   - Shows suggested major/minor/patch versions
   - Shows the new version you're creating

4. **Automatic Actions**:
   - Updates `package.json`
   - Commits the change
   - Creates git tag `vX.Y.Z`
   - Pushes to repository
   - Creates GitHub Release

### Semantic Versioning Guide

- **Major (X.0.0)**: Breaking changes, significant new features
  - Example: `1.5.3` â†’ `2.0.0`
  
- **Minor (X.Y.0)**: New features, backward-compatible changes
  - Example: `1.5.3` â†’ `1.6.0`
  
- **Patch (X.Y.Z)**: Bug fixes, minor improvements
  - Example: `1.5.3` â†’ `1.5.4`

### Rollback Process

If you need to undo a version:

```bash
# Delete tag locally and remotely
git tag -d vX.Y.Z
git push origin --delete vX.Y.Z

# Delete GitHub Release (via GitHub UI: Releases â†’ Delete)

# Revert package.json commit
git revert <commit-sha>
git push origin <branch>
```

## Benefits of Manual Versioning

1. **Simplicity**: No complex PR chain; create versions when you want
2. **Clarity**: Explicit control over major/minor/patch decisions
3. **Transparency**: Job summary shows current version and suggestions
4. **Safety**: Version validation and duplicate detection prevent mistakes
5. **Consistency**: Still uses git tags as source of truth
6. **No Breaking Changes**: CI, deployment, and version display all work unchanged

---

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/manual-version-bump.yml` - Enhanced with full version management
- `.github/workflows/versioning.yml` â†’ `.github/workflows/versioning.yml.disabled` - Disabled
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Updated versioning documentation
- `docs/deployment/versioning-system.md` - Comprehensive manual workflow guide

### Files Unchanged (Still Work!)
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Already derives version from git tags (lines 303-344)
- `package.json` - Will be updated by workflow, not manually
- `src/lib/version.ts` - Already derives from `VITE_APP_VERSION` or `package.json`
- `vite.config.ts` - Already reads version from `package.json`
- `scripts/get-version.sh` / `scripts/get-version.bat` - Still useful for local dev

### Workflow Behavior
- **Current Version Detection**: Reads latest git tag matching `v[0-9]*`
- **Suggestion Calculation**: Computes next major/minor/patch from current version
- **Version Validation**: Ensures format is `X.Y.Z` (numbers only)
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Fails if tag already exists
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on both Ubuntu and Windows self-hosted runners

## Next Steps

1. âœ… **Test the Workflow**: Run it once to verify it works correctly
2. âœ… **Update Team**: Inform maintainers about the new manual process
3. âœ… **Delete Old Tags**: If needed, clean up any test/broken tags
4. âœ… **Document Best Practices**: Establish when to create versions (e.g., after successful production deployment)

## Migration Complete! ðŸŽ‰

The versioning system is now fully manual and significantly simpler. You have complete control over when and how versions are created, with helpful suggestions and safety checks built in.

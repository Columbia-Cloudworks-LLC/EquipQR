## 5. Concurrency & Locking

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH**

Transaction management, isolation levels, deadlock prevention, and lock contention patterns.

### 5.1 Keep Transactions Short to Reduce Lock Contention

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH (3-5x throughput improvement, fewer deadlocks)**

Long-running transactions hold locks that block other queries. Keep transactions as short as possible.

**Incorrect (long transaction with external calls):**

```sql
begin;
select * from orders where id = 1 for update;  -- Lock acquired

-- Application makes HTTP call to payment API (2-5 seconds)
-- Other queries on this row are blocked!

update orders set status = 'paid' where id = 1;
commit;  -- Lock held for entire duration
```

**Correct (minimal transaction scope):**

```sql
-- Validate data and call APIs outside transaction
-- Application: response = await paymentAPI.charge(...)

-- Only hold lock for the actual update
begin;
update orders
set status = 'paid', payment_id = $1
where id = $2 and status = 'pending'
returning *;
commit;  -- Lock held for milliseconds
-- Abort queries running longer than 30 seconds
set statement_timeout = '30s';

-- Or per-session
set local statement_timeout = '5s';
```

Use `statement_timeout` to prevent runaway transactions:

Reference: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-transactions.html

---

### 5.2 Prevent Deadlocks with Consistent Lock Ordering

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH (Eliminate deadlock errors, improve reliability)**

Deadlocks occur when transactions lock resources in different orders. Always
acquire locks in a consistent order.

**Incorrect (inconsistent lock ordering):**

```sql
-- Transaction A                    -- Transaction B
begin;                              begin;
update accounts                     update accounts
set balance = balance - 100         set balance = balance - 50
where id = 1;                       where id = 2;  -- B locks row 2

update accounts                     update accounts
set balance = balance + 100         set balance = balance + 50
where id = 2;  -- A waits for B     where id = 1;  -- B waits for A

-- DEADLOCK! Both waiting for each other
```

**Correct (lock rows in consistent order first):**

```sql
-- Explicitly acquire locks in ID order before updating
begin;
select * from accounts where id in (1, 2) order by id for update;

-- Now perform updates in any order - locks already held
update accounts set balance = balance - 100 where id = 1;
update accounts set balance = balance + 100 where id = 2;
commit;
-- Single statement acquires all locks atomically
begin;
update accounts
set balance = balance + case id
  when 1 then -100
  when 2 then 100
end
where id in (1, 2);
commit;
-- Check for recent deadlocks
select * from pg_stat_database where deadlocks > 0;

-- Enable deadlock logging
set log_lock_waits = on;
set deadlock_timeout = '1s';
```

Alternative: use a single statement to update atomically:

---

### 5.3 Use Advisory Locks for Application-Level Locking

**Impact: MEDIUM (Efficient coordination without row-level lock overhead)**

Advisory locks provide application-level coordination without requiring database rows to lock.

**Incorrect (creating rows just for locking):**

```sql
-- Creating dummy rows to lock on
create table resource_locks (
  resource_name text primary key
);

insert into resource_locks values ('report_generator');

-- Lock by selecting the row
select * from resource_locks where resource_name = 'report_generator' for update;
```

**Correct (advisory locks):**

```sql
-- Session-level advisory lock (released on disconnect or unlock)
select pg_advisory_lock(hashtext('report_generator'));
-- ... do exclusive work ...
select pg_advisory_unlock(hashtext('report_generator'));

-- Transaction-level lock (released on commit/rollback)
begin;
select pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext('daily_report'));
-- ... do work ...
commit;  -- Lock automatically released
-- Returns immediately with true/false instead of waiting
select pg_try_advisory_lock(hashtext('resource_name'));

-- Use in application
if (acquired) {
  -- Do work
  select pg_advisory_unlock(hashtext('resource_name'));
} else {
  -- Skip or retry later
}
```

Try-lock for non-blocking operations:

Reference: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html#ADVISORY-LOCKS

---

### 5.4 Use SKIP LOCKED for Non-Blocking Queue Processing

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH (10x throughput for worker queues)**

When multiple workers process a queue, SKIP LOCKED allows workers to process different rows without waiting.

**Incorrect (workers block each other):**

```sql
-- Worker 1 and Worker 2 both try to get next job
begin;
select * from jobs where status = 'pending' order by created_at limit 1 for update;
-- Worker 2 waits for Worker 1's lock to release!
```

**Correct (SKIP LOCKED for parallel processing):**

```sql
-- Each worker skips locked rows and gets the next available
begin;
select * from jobs
where status = 'pending'
order by created_at
limit 1
for update skip locked;

-- Worker 1 gets job 1, Worker 2 gets job 2 (no waiting)

update jobs set status = 'processing' where id = $1;
commit;
-- Atomic claim-and-update in one statement
update jobs
set status = 'processing', worker_id = $1, started_at = now()
where id = (
  select id from jobs
  where status = 'pending'
  order by created_at
  limit 1
  for update skip locked
)
returning *;
```

---

## 6. Data Access Patterns

**Impact: MEDIUM**

N+1 query elimination, batch operations, cursor-based pagination, and efficient data fetching.

### 6.1 Batch INSERT Statements for Bulk Data

**Impact: MEDIUM (10-50x faster bulk inserts)**

Individual INSERT statements have high overhead. Batch multiple rows in single statements or use COPY.

**Incorrect (individual inserts):**

```sql
-- Each insert is a separate transaction and round trip
insert into events (user_id, action) values (1, 'click');
insert into events (user_id, action) values (1, 'view');
insert into events (user_id, action) values (2, 'click');
-- ... 1000 more individual inserts

-- 1000 inserts = 1000 round trips = slow
```

**Correct (batch insert):**

```sql
-- Multiple rows in single statement
insert into events (user_id, action) values
  (1, 'click'),
  (1, 'view'),
  (2, 'click'),
  -- ... up to ~1000 rows per batch
  (999, 'view');

-- One round trip for 1000 rows
-- COPY is fastest for bulk loading
copy events (user_id, action, created_at)
from '/path/to/data.csv'
with (format csv, header true);

-- Or from stdin in application
copy events (user_id, action) from stdin with (format csv);
1,click
1,view
2,click
\.
```

For large imports, use COPY:

Reference: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html

---

### 6.2 Eliminate N+1 Queries with Batch Loading

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH (10-100x fewer database round trips)**

N+1 queries execute one query per item in a loop. Batch them into a single query using arrays or JOINs.

**Incorrect (N+1 queries):**

```sql
-- First query: get all users
select id from users where active = true;  -- Returns 100 IDs

-- Then N queries, one per user
select * from orders where user_id = 1;
select * from orders where user_id = 2;
select * from orders where user_id = 3;
-- ... 97 more queries!

-- Total: 101 round trips to database
```

**Correct (single batch query):**

```sql
-- Collect IDs and query once with ANY
select * from orders where user_id = any(array[1, 2, 3, ...]);

-- Or use JOIN instead of loop
select u.id, u.name, o.*
from users u
left join orders o on o.user_id = u.id
where u.active = true;

-- Total: 1 round trip
-- Instead of looping in application code:
-- for user in users: db.query("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = $1", user.id)

-- Pass array parameter:
select * from orders where user_id = any($1::bigint[]);
-- Application passes: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...]
```

Application pattern:

Reference: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/query-optimization

---

### 6.3 Use Cursor-Based Pagination Instead of OFFSET

**Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH (Consistent O(1) performance regardless of page depth)**

OFFSET-based pagination scans all skipped rows, getting slower on deeper pages. Cursor pagination is O(1).

**Incorrect (OFFSET pagination):**

```sql
-- Page 1: scans 20 rows
select * from products order by id limit 20 offset 0;

-- Page 100: scans 2000 rows to skip 1980
select * from products order by id limit 20 offset 1980;

-- Page 10000: scans 200,000 rows!
select * from products order by id limit 20 offset 199980;
```

**Correct (cursor/keyset pagination):**

```sql
-- Page 1: get first 20
select * from products order by id limit 20;
-- Application stores last_id = 20

-- Page 2: start after last ID
select * from products where id > 20 order by id limit 20;
-- Uses index, always fast regardless of page depth

-- Page 10000: same speed as page 1
select * from products where id > 199980 order by id limit 20;
-- Cursor must include all sort columns
select * from products
where (created_at, id) > ('2024-01-15 10:00:00', 12345)
order by created_at, id
limit 20;
```

For multi-column sorting:

Reference: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/pagination

---

### 6.4 Use UPSERT for Insert-or-Update Operations

**Impact: MEDIUM (Atomic operation, eliminates race conditions)**

Using separate SELECT-then-INSERT/UPDATE creates race conditions. Use INSERT ... ON CONFLICT for atomic upserts.

**Incorrect (check-then-insert race condition):**

```sql
-- Race condition: two requests check simultaneously
select * from settings where user_id = 123 and key = 'theme';
-- Both find nothing

-- Both try to insert
insert into settings (user_id, key, value) values (123, 'theme', 'dark');
-- One succeeds, one fails with duplicate key error!
```

**Correct (atomic UPSERT):**

```sql
-- Single atomic operation
insert into settings (user_id, key, value)
values (123, 'theme', 'dark')
on conflict (user_id, key)
do update set value = excluded.value, updated_at = now();

-- Returns the inserted/updated row
insert into settings (user_id, key, value)
values (123, 'theme', 'dark')
on conflict (user_id, key)
do update set value = excluded.value
returning *;
-- Insert only if not exists (no update)
insert into page_views (page_id, user_id)
values (1, 123)
on conflict (page_id, user_id) do nothing;
```

Insert-or-ignore pattern:

Reference: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-insert.html#SQL-ON-CONFLICT

## 7. Monitoring & Diagnostics

**Impact: LOW-MEDIUM**

Using pg_stat_statements, EXPLAIN ANALYZE, metrics collection, and performance diagnostics.

### 7.1 Enable pg_stat_statements for Query Analysis

**Impact: LOW-MEDIUM (Identify top resource-consuming queries)**

pg_stat_statements tracks execution statistics for all queries, helping identify slow and frequent queries.

**Incorrect (no visibility into query patterns):**

```sql
-- Database is slow, but which queries are the problem?
-- No way to know without pg_stat_statements
```

**Correct (enable and query pg_stat_statements):**

```sql
-- Enable the extension
create extension if not exists pg_stat_statements;

-- Find slowest queries by total time
select
  calls,
  round(total_exec_time::numeric, 2) as total_time_ms,
  round(mean_exec_time::numeric, 2) as mean_time_ms,
  query
from pg_stat_statements
order by total_exec_time desc
limit 10;

-- Find most frequent queries
select calls, query
from pg_stat_statements
order by calls desc
limit 10;

-- Reset statistics after optimization
select pg_stat_statements_reset();
-- Queries with high mean time (candidates for optimization)
select query, mean_exec_time, calls
from pg_stat_statements
where mean_exec_time > 100  -- > 100ms average
order by mean_exec_time desc;
```

Key metrics to monitor:

Reference: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/pg_stat_statements

---

### 7.2 Maintain Table Statistics with VACUUM and ANALYZE

**Impact: MEDIUM (2-10x better query plans with accurate statistics)**

Outdated statistics cause the query planner to make poor decisions. VACUUM reclaims space, ANALYZE updates statistics.

**Incorrect (stale statistics):**

```sql
-- Table has 1M rows but stats say 1000
-- Query planner chooses wrong strategy
explain select * from orders where status = 'pending';
-- Shows: Seq Scan (because stats show small table)
-- Actually: Index Scan would be much faster
```

**Correct (maintain fresh statistics):**

```sql
-- Manually analyze after large data changes
analyze orders;

-- Analyze specific columns used in WHERE clauses
analyze orders (status, created_at);

-- Check when tables were last analyzed
select
  relname,
  last_vacuum,
  last_autovacuum,
  last_analyze,
  last_autoanalyze
from pg_stat_user_tables
order by last_analyze nulls first;
-- Increase frequency for high-churn tables
alter table orders set (
  autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.05,     -- Vacuum at 5% dead tuples (default 20%)
  autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.02     -- Analyze at 2% changes (default 10%)
);

-- Check autovacuum status
select * from pg_stat_progress_vacuum;
```

Autovacuum tuning for busy tables:

Reference: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/database-size#vacuum-operations

---

### 7.3 Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to Diagnose Slow Queries

**Impact: LOW-MEDIUM (Identify exact bottlenecks in query execution)**

EXPLAIN ANALYZE executes the query and shows actual timings, revealing the true performance bottlenecks.

**Incorrect (guessing at performance issues):**

```sql
-- Query is slow, but why?
select * from orders where customer_id = 123 and status = 'pending';
-- "It must be missing an index" - but which one?
```

**Correct (use EXPLAIN ANALYZE):**

```sql
explain (analyze, buffers, format text)
select * from orders where customer_id = 123 and status = 'pending';

-- Output reveals the issue:
-- Seq Scan on orders (cost=0.00..25000.00 rows=50 width=100) (actual time=0.015..450.123 rows=50 loops=1)
--   Filter: ((customer_id = 123) AND (status = 'pending'::text))
--   Rows Removed by Filter: 999950
--   Buffers: shared hit=5000 read=15000
-- Planning Time: 0.150 ms
-- Execution Time: 450.500 ms
-- Seq Scan on large tables = missing index
-- Rows Removed by Filter = poor selectivity or missing index
-- Buffers: read >> hit = data not cached, needs more memory
-- Nested Loop with high loops = consider different join strategy
-- Sort Method: external merge = work_mem too low
```

Key things to look for:

## 8. Advanced Features

**Impact: LOW**

Full-text search, JSONB optimization, PostGIS, extensions, and advanced Postgres features.

### 8.1 Index JSONB Columns for Efficient Querying

**Impact: MEDIUM (10-100x faster JSONB queries with proper indexing)**

JSONB queries without indexes scan the entire table. Use GIN indexes for containment queries.

**Incorrect (no index on JSONB):**

```sql
create table products (
  id bigint primary key,
  attributes jsonb
);

-- Full table scan for every query
select * from products where attributes @> '{"color": "red"}';
select * from products where attributes->>'brand' = 'Nike';
```

**Correct (GIN index for JSONB):**

```sql
-- GIN index for containment operators (@>, ?, ?&, ?|)
create index products_attrs_gin on products using gin (attributes);

-- Now containment queries use the index
select * from products where attributes @> '{"color": "red"}';

-- For specific key lookups, use expression index
create index products_brand_idx on products ((attributes->>'brand'));
select * from products where attributes->>'brand' = 'Nike';
-- jsonb_ops (default): supports all operators, larger index
create index idx1 on products using gin (attributes);

-- jsonb_path_ops: only @> operator, but 2-3x smaller index
create index idx2 on products using gin (attributes jsonb_path_ops);
```

Choose the right operator class:

Reference: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html#JSON-INDEXING

---

### 8.2 Use tsvector for Full-Text Search

**Impact: MEDIUM (100x faster than LIKE, with ranking support)**

LIKE with wildcards can't use indexes. Full-text search with tsvector is orders of magnitude faster.

**Incorrect (LIKE pattern matching):**

```sql
-- Cannot use index, scans all rows
select * from articles where content like '%postgresql%';

-- Case-insensitive makes it worse
select * from articles where lower(content) like '%postgresql%';
```

**Correct (full-text search with tsvector):**

```sql
-- Add tsvector column and index
alter table articles add column search_vector tsvector
  generated always as (to_tsvector('english', coalesce(title,'') || ' ' || coalesce(content,''))) stored;

create index articles_search_idx on articles using gin (search_vector);

-- Fast full-text search
select * from articles
where search_vector @@ to_tsquery('english', 'postgresql & performance');

-- With ranking
select *, ts_rank(search_vector, query) as rank
from articles, to_tsquery('english', 'postgresql') query
where search_vector @@ query
order by rank desc;
-- AND: both terms required
to_tsquery('postgresql & performance')

-- OR: either term
to_tsquery('postgresql | mysql')

-- Prefix matching
to_tsquery('post:*')
```

Search multiple terms:

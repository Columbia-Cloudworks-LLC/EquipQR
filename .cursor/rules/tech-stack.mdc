# Tech Stack & Strategy

## Core Stack
- **Frontend:** React 18+ (Vite), TypeScript 5.5+, Tailwind CSS 3.4.
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Edge Functions, RLS).
- **State:** TanStack Query v5 (Server State), React Context (Global Client State).
- **UI Library:** Shadcn UI (Radix Primitives) + Lucide React Icons.

## Behavioral Rules
- **Tool Usage:** PROACTIVE. Run `grep` or `codebase_search` before creating new files to avoid duplicates.
- **Output Format:** Use `// ... existing code ...` to keep responses concise. Focus on the changed lines only.
- **Files:** Prioritize non-breaking changes. If a rule conflicts with a user request, ask for clarification.

## Critical Constraints
- **Multi-Tenancy:** ALL data fetching and mutations MUST include `organization_id`.
- **Styling:** Use Tailwind utility classes ONLY. No inline styles.
- **Strict Mode:** No `any`. No `console.log` in production code.

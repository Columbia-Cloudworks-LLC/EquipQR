# Git & PowerShell Conventions

This workspace runs on Windows with PowerShell. All git commands must avoid bash-only syntax.

## Commit Messages

**Never use heredoc** (`<<'EOF'`) — PowerShell does not support it.

Use one of these approaches instead:

### Multi `-m` flags (preferred for short messages)
```powershell
git commit -m "fix: summary line" -m "- Detail one" -m "- Detail two"
```

### Temp file (preferred for long or complex messages)
```powershell
@"
fix: summary line

- Detail one with "quotes" and special chars
- Detail two
"@ | Set-Content -Path ".git/COMMIT_MSG" -Encoding utf8
git commit -F ".git/COMMIT_MSG"
Remove-Item ".git/COMMIT_MSG"
```

## Other Rules

- **Quote paths** with double quotes: `git add "path with spaces/file.ts"`
- **Do not use** `&&` to chain commands — use `;` or separate calls instead, since `&&` requires PowerShell 7+.
- **Do not use** `$(...)` bash-style command substitution in git arguments.

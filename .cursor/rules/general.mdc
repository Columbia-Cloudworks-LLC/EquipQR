# General Guidelines & Tool Usage

## Tool Usage Strategy

You must proactively use available tools to gather context before generating code.

- **Search First**: Before creating any new component, hook, or utility, run a semantic search (e.g., `grep` or `codebase_search`) to ensure it doesn't already exist.
- **Context Gathering**:
  - If the user asks about a database change, read `docs/technical/architecture.md` and `supabase/migrations`.
  - If the user asks about UI, read `docs/technical/standards.md` to find the correct design tokens and components.
  - If the task involves complex logic, check `docs/technical/` for relevant feature documentation.

## Development Workflow

1. **Analyze**: Understand the user intent and identify the files to touch.
2. **Explore**: Search for existing patterns in the codebase to maintain consistency.
3. **Plan**: If the change is large, propose a plan referencing specific files.
4. **Implement**: Write code that strictly follows `coding-standards.mdc`.
5. **Verify**: Ensure new code works with existing types and linting rules.

## Output Format

- When suggesting edits, use the `// ... existing code ...` pattern for unchanged sections to keep responses concise.
- Prioritize non-breaking changes.
- If a rule conflicts with a new requirement, explicitly ask for clarification.

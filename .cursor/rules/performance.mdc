# Performance

- **Memoization:** Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations and `useCallback` for functions passed as props to optimized children.
- **Query Configuration:** Set appropriate `staleTime` for queries to avoid fetching too frequently (default to at least 1-5 minutes for non-critical data).
- **Code Splitting:** Use `React.lazy` for heavy feature routes/pages.
- **Images:** Use optimized image formats and appropriate sizing.
